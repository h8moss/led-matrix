# Led Matrix Controller

A simple C++ script that allows you to control a led matrix with a bunch of different animations and images, using [rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix)

# Animations
- [x] Shifting colors
- [x] Game of life
- [x] The time and date
- [ ] Rotating square
- [ ] Rotating cube
- [ ] Mandelbrot set
- [ ] That one donut rendering thing that appears on YT
- [ ] Snake
- [ ] Pong
- [ ] Sorting algorithms

## Other planned animations

- [ ] Arbitrary images
- [ ] Arbitrary videos
- [ ] Arbitrary text
- [ ] Arbitrary drawings


# Usage

In order to use this thing, you gotta compile it first (I know, if I figure out how, maybe I'll add releases one day)

To build this project you will need to have git, cmake and make installed on your raspberry pi.
Said raspberry pi must also be set up with a led matrix

To compile, on the raspberry pi run the following:

(note, if you want help connecting the raspberry pi to an led matrix, I will make a tutorial at some point)

```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/h8moss/led-matrix"  # Clone the repository
$ cd led-matrix/build-scripts                       # Go into the project's build scripts
$ ./build.sh                                        # Generate the build files
$ cd ../build                                       # Go into the build directory
$ make                                              # Actually build this project
```

That should leave you with either an error, or two executables `led-matrix` and `led-matrix-manager`, both of these
must be run with `sudo`

`led-matrix` runs using flags and the command line, it should hopefully give you a self explanatory "usage" message if 
you just run `sudo led-matrix`, `sudo led-matrix --help` and `sudo led-matrix <MODULE> --helá¹•`

`led-matrix-manager` works similarly, but receives the command line arguments from a fifo, allowing it to be controlled through IPC

# Fonts

The time-date module (and one day, the text module) displays text and thus, needs a font, rpi-rgb-led-matrix comes with a bunch of default fonts for simple usage, once the project has been built, the list of fonts can be found on:
`led-matrix/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/src/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/fonts`
Here, you may add your own font files, as long as they are in .bdf format, it is not hard to find online converters from other formats into this one, once there, you can set them using the cli options of each module
